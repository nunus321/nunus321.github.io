For my final year at Danish gymnasium I develop a mobile application 
that estimates a user’s blood-alcohol content (BAC) with nothing more than the 
phone in their pocket. After a brief set-up where the user enters weight and biological sex, 
the app calculates BAC in real time each time a drink is added, relying on the official equations 
published by the danish national health portal, Sundhed.dk. 

It also explains the typical side-effects at 
different BAC levels, indicates when it is unsafe to drive, keeps daily and weekly consumption 
statistics and even shows a countdown to the point at which the user is expected to be sober again. 
The project gave me hands-on experience with mobile UI design, data validation and the challenge of 
translating clinical formulas into efficient, user-friendly code
