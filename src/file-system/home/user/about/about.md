# Hi there

My name is Jonas Mersal, a computer-science student at the University of Copenhagen. I wrote my first lines of code in primary school and never stopped; by high school I was leading ambitious class projects and finishing the course with top marks. Today Iâ€™m especially drawn to machine learning, AI, and software development, turning ideas into everything from compact neural-network prototypes to full-stack web apps.

In addition to my love of technology, I follow politics, dive into competitive gaming, and push my limits in the gym.
